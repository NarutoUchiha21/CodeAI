# Code Analysis and Re-implementation System

A sophisticated AI-powered system for analyzing codebases and generating detailed specifications for re-implementation. This system uses advanced semantic analysis, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent collaboration to understand and reconstruct software systems.

## Features

- **Semantic Code Analysis**: Deep understanding of code structure, patterns, and relationships
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Visual representation of code dependencies and relationships
- **Specification Generation**: Automatic creation of detailed implementation specifications
- **Multi-Agent Implementation**: Collaborative agents for code generation and refinement
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of design patterns, architectural patterns, and code smells
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement of generated code through validation and feedback

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Code Analyzer** (`code_analyzer.py`)
   - Performs semantic analysis of codebases
   - Detects patterns and anti-patterns
   - Analyzes code complexity and maintainability

2. **Knowledge Graph** (`knowledge_graph.py`)
   - Creates semantic relationships between code entities
   - Visualizes code dependencies
   - Identifies core components and their impact

3. **Strategy Generator** (`strategy_generator.py`)
   - Generates implementation strategies
   - Plans implementation steps
   - Manages dependencies between components

4. **Code Generator** (`code_generator.py`)
   - Implements code based on specifications
   - Performs multi-turn synthesis
   - Refines code through iterative improvement

5. **Agent Orchestrator** (`agent_orchestrator.py`)
   - Coordinates multiple specialized agents
   - Manages communication between agents
   - Handles the implementation workflow

### Data Models

The system uses structured data models (`models.py`) to represent:
- Code entities (classes, functions, modules)
- Specifications
- Implementation steps and strategies
- Analysis results
- Agent states and messages

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-analysis-system.git
cd code-analysis-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Running the System

To analyze a codebase and generate specifications:

```bash
python main.py --codebase /path/to/codebase --config config.json --output results
```

Arguments:
- `--codebase`: Path to the codebase to analyze (required)
- `--config`: Path to configuration file (optional)
- `--output`: Output directory for results (optional)

### Output

The system generates several output files:
- `analysis_*.json`: Codebase analysis results
- `knowledge_graph_*.json`: Knowledge graph representation
- `specifications_*.json`: Generated specifications
- `strategy_*.json`: Implementation strategy
- `implementation_*.json`: Implementation results

## Agent Roles

The system uses several specialized agents:

1. **Architect**: Designs the overall system architecture
2. **Translator**: Converts specifications to implementation details
3. **Programmer**: Generates actual code
4. **Reviewer**: Reviews code for quality and correctness
5. **Refiner**: Improves code based on feedback
6. **Validator**: Validates code against specifications
7. **Coordinator**: Manages the overall process

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file to customize the system:

```json
{
  "output_dir": "output",
  "analysis": {
    "max_file_size": 1048576,
    "excluded_dirs": [".git", "node_modules", "__pycache__"]
  },
  "generation": {
    "max_iterations": 3,
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "agents": {
    "timeout": 300,
    "max_retries": 3
  }
}
```
